                    </center>
                    <p>Two thirds of the world’s indigenous peoples live in Asia, which is home to more than 2,000
                        civilizations and languages. They include groups that ore often referred to as tribal peoples,
                        hill tribes,
                        scheduled tribes, janajati, orang asli, masyarakat adat, adivasis, ethnic minorities or
                        nationalities. Irrespective of
                        their legal status or the terminology used, many indigenous peoples of Asia experience
                        nonrecognition of their cultural identity, exclusion and marginalization.

                        While the concept of “indigenous peoples” is rarely incorporated into national laws and
                        constitutions, discriminatory approaches and stigma that depict indigenous peoples as
                        “economically
                        backward and primitive” persist. There is some progress, though. The Philippines Indigenous
                        Peoples Rights Act (Republic Act No. 8371 of 29 October 1997) is one of the first laws in Asia
                        that
                        recognizes indigenous peoples’ rights to their ancestral domains and to cultural integrity,
                        including
                        the right to self-governance and self-determination. Nepal lists 59 indigenous nationalities who
                        have
                        their own mother tongue and traditional customs, different cultural identity, distinct social
                        structure
                        and written or oral history, and is the only Asian country to ratify ILO Convention No. 169 on
                        Indigenous and Tribal Peoples in 2007. In 2008, Japan recognized the Ainu people as indigenous
                        to
                        Hokkaido. </p>

                            Asian indigenous peoples often experience displacement and relocation from their traditional
                            territories, and dispossession of their lands and resources by both government-led and
                            private-led
                            projects engaged in extractive industries, logging, large-scale plantations, mega-projects
                            and dams.
                            The Indonesian Constitutional Court’s decision of May 2013 marks a turning point in this
                            regard.
                            The Court’s decision No. 35/PUU-X/2012 found that customary forests are no longer state
                            forests,
                            recognizing the right of indigenous peoples to manage the lands in which they live.

                            Indigenous peoples have lower levels of educational achievement and higher dropout rates
                            than
                            other segments of the population due to lack of education programmes in indigenous
                            languages,
                            culturally inappropriate curricula, distance of schools from indigenous communities, and
                            inadequate accommodation. In Laos, for example, 34 per cent of rural Tai girls had never
                            attended school in
                            2002-2003.

                            In South and South-East Asia, indigenous peoples’ agricultural practices such as shifting
                            cultivation,
                            also known as rotational agriculture, also reinforces indigenous peoples’ economic, social
                            and
                            cultural integrity.3
                            Nevertheless, in the majority of Asian countries, traditional subsistence activities
                            are threatened by a range of infrastructure, development, agro-industrial and conservation
                            projects.
                            The Bakun Dam in Malaysia for example is reported to have caused the forced displacement of
                            5,000-8,000 indigenous persons from 15 communities by clear-cutting 80,000 hectares of
                            rainforest.
