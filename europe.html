                    </center>
                    <p>The Sámi are the only indigenous people within the European Union area. Sápmi, the region the
                        Sámi inhabit across four countries, consists of northern parts of Finland, almost half of Sweden
                        and Norway, as well as parts of the Kola Peninsula in Russia.
                        Out of the ten Sámi languages, nine are still spoken. Three of these are spoken in Finland:
                        North Sámi, Inari Sámi and Skolt Sámi.
                        Sámi culture includes their language, cultural heritage and cultural expressions, Sámi art,
                        traditional knowledge of the Sámi, traditional livelihoods and the modern ways of practicing
                        them, as well as other cultural traditions and manifestations practiced by the Sámi as
                        indigenous people.
                        For example, the Sámi language, stories, music, as well as the most visible symbols of the Sámi
                        culture – Sámi outfits and handicrafts – are essentially intertwined with, among other things,
                        traditional Sámi livelihoods. Together they form an inseparable holistic whole in which every
                        element of the Sámi culture needs the others to remain viable in order to develop and transmit
                        to future generations.
                        The traditional Sámi livelihoods are fishing, gathering, handicrafts, hunting and reindeer
                        herding and the modern ways of practicing them. Out of the traditional livelihoods, reindeer
                        herding still functions as one of the cornerstones of the Sámi culture, offering both a language
                        arena as well as material for, among others, clothing, Sámi handicrafts and food culture. Ever
                        since the development of reindeer herding, reindeer has been an important form of
                        transportation. Today, tourists can experience the traditional form of transportation in the
                        form of reindeer sleigh rides in winter time.

                        <h2 class="text-black mt-5">Origin of Sámi People</h2>
                    </center>
                    <p class="text-black mt-5">The genetic origin of the Sámi is still unknown, though recent genetic research may be providing some clues.
                        Saami people's Siberian ancestry varies between 20%-25%, while the bronze age individuals from Bolshoy Oleny Island by the Kola peninsula had around 40% of similar ancestry, accompanied with roughly 50% Mesolithic Eastern Hunter-Gatherer ancestry. 
                       Archeological evidence suggests that people along the southern shores of Lake Onega and around Lake Ladoga reached the River Utsjoki in Northern Finnish Lapland before 8100 BC. However, it is not likely that Sami languages are so old. According to the comparative linguist Ante Aikio, the Sami proto-language developed in South Finland or in Karelia around 2000–2500 years ago, spreading then to northern Fennoscandia

                        <h2 class="text-black mt-5">Sámi Languages</h2>
                    </center>
                    <p class="text-black mt-5">In terms of internal relationships, the Sami languages are divided into two groups: western and eastern. The groups may be further divided into various subgroups and ultimately individual languages. (Sammallahti 1998: 6-38.) Parts of the Sami language area form a dialect continuum in which the neighbouring languages may be mutually intelligible to a fair degree, but two more widely separated groups will not understand each other's speech. There are, however, some sharp language boundaries, in particular between Northern Sami, Inari Sami and Skolt Sami, the speakers of which are not able to understand each other without learning or long practice. The evolution of sharp language boundaries seems to suggest a relative isolation of the language speakers from each other and not very intensive contacts between the respective speakers in the past. There is some significance in this, as the geographical barriers between the respective speakers are no different from those in other parts of the Sami area.
